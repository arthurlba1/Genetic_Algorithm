# Genetic Algorithm

Genetic Algorithms to find the maximum point of a
function in the form _F(x1,x2,x3,x4,x5) = y_.

##### Genetic algorithm inputs
- Search range
- Mutation rate
- Population
- Number of genetions

>Function must be entered at implementation level.

>Search Range: the same applied for all values ​​of x.

##### Algorithm output
- Function _F(x)_
- _x1, x2, x3,x4_ and _x5_ of the best individual in each generation

## Elitism
The Elitist technique consists of reintroducing the best-evaluated individual from one
generation to the next, avoiding the loss of important information present in
high-evaluated individuals, which may be lost during the selection and crossing processes.
In this genetic algorithm, elitism serves the 3 best individuals


## Binary tournament selection
Two individuals are drawn at random, their aptitudes are compared and the fittest of
these two is selected. This procedure is repeated for each individual to be selected.

## Crossover
The crossover system takes two individuals from the generation and changes their 'DNA' or
in this case their function values. As there are 5 values, it's divided in half and creates
a child with half of each parent individual.

~~~python
    crossover_individuals = []
        for i in range(int(len(population)*(100-mutation_rate)/100)):
            individual_one = random.choice(population)
            individual_two = random.choice(population)
            x1 = individual_one.x1
            x2 = individual_one.x2
            x3 = individual_one.x3
            x4 = individual_two.x4
            x5 = individual_two.x5
            crossover_individuals.append(Individual(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5))
        return crossover_individuals
~~~

## Mutation
Mutation brings diversity to the population.
There are different kinds of mutations like Bit Flip mutation, Swap mutation, Inversion mutation, etc.
In this algorithm we use bit flip.
The value of some 'x' is randomly generated again

~~~python
    mutation_list = []
        for i in range(int(len(population-3)*mutation_rate/100)):
            individual = random.choice(population)
            mutation_one = random.randint(1,5)
            print(f'{individual} before')
            individual = MutationCase.mutation_case_elseif(mutation_one, individual)
            print(f'{individual} after')
            mutation_list.append(individual)
        return mutation_list
~~~
